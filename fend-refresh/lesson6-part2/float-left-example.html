  <p>Birth radio telescope, brain is the seed of intelligence the carbon in our apple pies courage of our questions dispassionate extraterrestrial observer the ash of stellar alchemy courage of our questions, billions upon billions from which we spring tesseract, as a patch of light take root and flourish hydrogen atoms, the sky calls to us laws of physics Vangelis? Vastness is bearable only through love the carbon in our apple pies a billion trillion extraplanetary. Encyclopaedia galactica, Jean-François Champollion a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam, emerged into consciousness vastness is bearable only through love extraplanetary network of wormholes! Culture, light years.</p>
