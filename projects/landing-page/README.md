## Description

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. It required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and view the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions linking to this project, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Process

Firstly, I linked the `js/app.js` to the  `index.html`.

I created a **fourth** content section in the `index.html`.

I created the helper functions to create the **list** for the nav-bar, then I created the **active class** scroll for the section and lastly for the helper function I created the **scrollTo** function for when you click a link.  

Then I worked on the main functions. I used the main functions to basically call the helper functions that work the same.

Finally, I begin events by calling the main functions.

In summary, I built the menu bar, created a **scrollTo** link to the **sections** and lastly I created an **active class** scroll function.

## Dependencies
I used a starter-code from *[refresh-2019](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page)*
